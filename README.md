# raylib-projects
A collection of programs utilising the Raylib library for educational purposes. These are some experimental programs I made to learn the library, so they might also be good for other beginners to look through for a reference. 

Each directory from the project's root contains a different program (Each directory has its own main.c and Makefile), as described in the sections below.

Make is used to build the programs.

Raylib must be installed to build the programs, which can be found at: www.raylib.com/
